<h2 id="scrum-master-rotation">Scrum Master Rotation</h2>

<p>My team has implemented a Scrum Master rotation and just finished up the first 2 months
of it. We had a retrospective dedicated just to this new process and had a lot of
great feedback from it.</p>

<p>I found that it provided a whole different perspective on what we do and how we
understand Scrum. But, I found that this also helped really protect the sprint
with this rotation, we decided to make he rotation last 3 months and extended
the current person another month. We also selected the next person that will
take the duties of Scrum Master.</p>

<h2 id="metrics-collection">Metrics Collection</h2>

<p>As part of this rotation we have started to break down our stories into tasks
better, well actually to doing it. We havenï¿½t been breaking them down to the
task level. I am one that likes to keep the stories very small which could make
it harder for tasks, but love the idea of having the tasks written and thought it.
It provide much better understanding of the story and helps with commitments
that are made.</p>

<p>When breaking down our stories we are not trying to estimate hours on the tasks
and log hours against the tasks for daily tracking. This is now looked at during
daily stand up meetings. The idea is that we can learn more about our points by
looking at the actual hours that it takes to do the work. Also, it the metrics
could be used to show resource gaps that we have.</p>

<p>Do you collect metrics other than story points during your sprints?
Do you use them in your daily stand-ups? How do you break tasks down.
I would love to hear from you how how your scrum works. Have you ever rotated
the Scrum Master role?</p>
