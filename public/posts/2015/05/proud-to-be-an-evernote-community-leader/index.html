<p>I started using Evernote back in 2011 and have found it to be so valuable to my everyday life. I use Evernote
to log notes about my professional and personal life.</p>

<p>I keep my notes in Evernote organized with tags and notebooks. I have found it so easy to find information
that I created. The ability to have my notes with me on my phone and computer made information easily available at anytime.
I will never forgot when we first went to Disney World and had an issue on our first day. I was able to
pull up the notes that I recorded and all information so fast with my phone. I just grabbed my phone, opened
Evernote and searched for Disney.</p>

<p>The situation was very easily resolved and we enjoyed a wonderful magical vacation at Disney.
Since then I have been using Evernote even more. The Evernote Web Clipper opened even more possibilities
for me. I created a notebook called Articles To Read and clip articles to this notebook to read later.
I can highlight sections in the article to make the information even more valuable to me.
When I talk to people about Evernote I also show how I can snap a picture and search for the text in the
picture so easily and fast. I am always so excited when I do this. I know, I am a geek! ðŸ™‚
I have seen Evernote Ambassadors, tweeted with them and read their blogs and books. I wanted to become one!
I believe in Evernote so much that I just want to share how I use it and help others use Evernote
and learn from how they use Evernote.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was asked to give a few presentations at a professional development day for a local
school district. I proposed one talk on Evernote and one on Agile. Both talks went excellent. I showed
how I used Evernote and talked with the administrators and teachers about how they could use
it for themselves. We created accounts and installed Evernote on their devices. It was a great
success and another proud moment in my Evernote history.</p>

<p>Recently I found out about the <a href="https://evernote.com/community">Evernote Community Leader program</a>. I applied for the
Evernote Community Leader program. I then took a very detailed course about using Evernote,
organizing and the different levels of the Evernote Service. I had great discussions with other people in the program.</p>

<p>When I received an email that I was accepted to be an Evernote Community Leader I was so excited!
Now, I as an Evernote Community Leader I have some goals that I would like to achieve and would
love to talk to anyone about using Evernote.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write blog posts about using Evernote</li>
<li>Facilitate workshops on using Evernote</li>
<li>Offer advice and consulting on Evernote</li>
<li>Create an Evernote Community Leader discussion group on use Educational Technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Sign up for an Evernote account if you do not already have one. The link below will take you to a sign-up page,
you can scroll to the bottom to create a Basic (free) account or enhance your experience with a paid account.
I subscribe to the Premium level.
Everything you write, everywhere you go
Evernote is designed for modern writing. From project plans to meeting notes, the latest versions of
everything you write are automatically available across your devices.</p>
