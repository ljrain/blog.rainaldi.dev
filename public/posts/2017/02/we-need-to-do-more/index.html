<blockquote>
<p>Last year it was 129 a day that we lost from overdose, this year it is 144 a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="144-a-day">144 A Day</h2>

<p>We have to do more. We have to take action and speak out and help people. We have to find ways to help
people even when they are NOT ready. We have to make them ready.
I watched a video on Facebook this morning that really touches this point. There are so many people
suffering with addiction and a small percentage are in recovery. How can we lower the amount that die from
overdose. How can we help loved ones that know the nightmare of addiction.</p>

<p>We have to think differently, the current approach is NOT working. I donï¿½t have the answers, I wish I did. B
ut, I do believe that there are many people with the heart, passionate and SHINE that are willing to help and make a difference.
I have spoke about my goals and I still believe they can make a difference. Think of the random acts of kindness,
simple things that everyone can do.</p>

<ul>
<li>End the stigma with addiction and overdose</li>
<li>Educate people on the epidemic and this health crisis</li>
<li>Celebrate recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to see more programs in schools. I would like to see more strong relationships based on love and caring.</p>

<p>People who want to help others and are willing to work together.
Are you willing to help?</p>
