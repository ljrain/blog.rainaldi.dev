<p>As a technologist I have worked on several different types of teams over my 20+ years of technology development career. Also, as a person I have been involved in different types of groups of people that are working together to solve a common problem or outcome. Several years ago I began a journey with Agile and started working on a Scrum team.</p>

<p>I became a Certified Scrum Master and learned from some very intelligent and passionate people who know Agile and Scrum.</p>

<p>I have built relationships so I can continue to learn, I believe that you must always continue to learn and never become stagnant.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted to share a blog series that two people that I know and learned from wrote. They have been
instrumental in my Agile journey and I am grateful for the knowledge they have shared and continue to share.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agile seems easy until people get involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote from the blog series is spot on! Agile does appear very simple, but once you start working on
an Agile team with other people it gets difficult. There is confusion, tension and personalities. This
must be addressed for any process and Agile has tenants that are geared towards this.</p>

<p>This post is about sharing the series, Agile Leaders, that Russ and Jay wrote, I encourage you to read
the series to learn about Agile. I would also like to hear you experiences with Agile. I will be writing
more about my thoughts on working in an Agile team and my experiences and frustrations.</p>

<p>I think on of the biggest benefits and struggles of Agile is the short iterations. Delivering something
on a short schedule that others can provide feedback on. I say this is a benefit and struggle because first,
it is better to identify misunderstandings of requirements early on. Struggles, well anytime you are trying
to deliver something complex in a short time, frustration and challenges come to the forefront. Personally,
I love challenges, maybe that is why I chose the field I am in.</p>

<p>I would like to hear from you, do you work on an Agile team? What are your thoughts on Agile? How do you
apply Agile in other work that is NOT development? I am using Agile to start a non-profit that I am working on
and will provide my thoughts as I progress.</p>

<p><em>Full Disclosure: I work for Russ and Jay at the same company. This post is NOT an affiliate link but just
something that I believe in. I do NOT write about anything on this blog that I personally donï¿½t agree with.
My opinions are my own.</em></p>
