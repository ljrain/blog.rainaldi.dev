<p>This year saw changes in my work life, I was contacted by a previous employer to come
back as a principal engineer. The company and boss made this decision very easy, now
that I am at a large international company some of my daily responsibilities have changed.
But, all in all I am doing the same thing that I have been doing for that past 15+ years.
I have been very involved with the social media communities and especially Pittsburgh
based communities. I have been honored to be a Carnegie Science Center Insider and I
have been writing posts on PghDad.me about the Science Center with special insider access.</p>

<p>I have been working with WordPress this year a lot and diving more into blogging which
help me create this site and also 2 additional sites now. I have more regularly blogged
at PghDad.me, which is a site that I use for parenting/family and Pittsburgh. I blog
about many different ideas and thoughts with PghDad.me but everything revolves around
family and/or Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site, Rainaldi.org, which I plan to become more active with this year
is my technical site. Which is extension of what I do professionally, as a principal
engineer and a tech geek I use all kinds of technologies both personally and professional.
This site is a place to write and share my feelings about what I am doing and learning.
This year also saw the re-launch of our churchï¿½s web site at Stewart Avenue Lutheran,
I have bee more involved with the church this year not only with the site but also
with social media and Sunday School. By the grace of God I am here and blessed to have a
wonderful family and life and I am honored to belong to such a wonderful church family as well.</p>

<p>A new site that will officially be launched January 1st 2013 is TalkWithDaddy.com, this is a
project that my children and I are diving in to. Talk With Daddy is a web show that will
revolve around talks and experiences with my children.</p>

<p>I wish each and everyone of you a happy and safe new year and look forward to a bright 2013.</p>
