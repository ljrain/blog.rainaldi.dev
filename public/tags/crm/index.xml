      <description>I was able to attend CRMUG Summit again this year. The 2017 Summit was hosted in Nashville, TN at the Gaylord Opryland Resort. I have been so impressed with the amount of content and the people who attend Summit both times now.
My Goals Before I leave for the Summit, I always prepare by listing out my goals. The number of sessions available is amazing and it is very easy to become overwhelmed and miss some very good sessions.</description>

      <description>Dynamics 365 Users In Pittsburgh ï¿½ User Helping Users Last year I attended the CRMUG Summit in Tampa and have to say I was very impressed with everything that I was involved in. During the summit I attended two classes in the Black Belt Series and completed the series when I returned to Pittsburgh. The information that I learned in this series I put to immediate use on our Dynamics 365 project.</description>
