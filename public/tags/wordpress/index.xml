      <description>Pittsburgh Blogger Facebook Group Emily over at emilylevenson.com created a new Facebook group for Pittsburgh Bloggers, I joined the group right away. Those who do not know her, she also create Project: Food Budget which I have participate in for helping to manage my family&amp;rsquo;s food spending. I love the idea of a group for people who blog around Pittsburgh to communicate and get to know each other better. I am a new one to the blogging arena, I am not new to the web or Internet though.</description>

      <description>Introducing the new Rainaldi.org Well, as part of my cleanup and organization project with my domain names I decided to keep Rainaldi.org as my �resume� and technology blog. I will blog about things that I work with as well as new technologies.
Having been in the computer industry professionally for over 15 years now, I have been involved in projects covering various aspects of technology throughout several industries. I have benefited from this depth by gaining a strong knowledge of solution design and business practices from some of the best people in the industry and expanding my knowledge set to handling many different situations.</description>

      <description>Backup Buddy for WordPress Part of the project I am on involves moving the entire WordPress site from our internal data center to an Amazon EC2 zone. Backup Buddy was recommended by a consultant that we are working with and I tested it against a Go Daddy account first.
Well, let&amp;rsquo;s same this is a fantastic plugin, I backed up the entire site (database and files) and moved the ZIP file as well as the importbuddy.</description>

      <description>WordPress Well, let me start by saying that my background has always been in Microsoft technologies (VB, C#, ASP.NET SQL Server, etc). But, I have used others such as Java, Oracle, Sybase, PHP and MySQL; this has always been a strong point of my background that I can easily switch between environments.
A recent project at work pushed my hand to learn WordPress and like I usually do I jumped in full force.</description>
