      <description>UPDATED: March 10, 2019
Welcome to my new blog! I have had many different sites over the years.
Recently, a few months ago I decided to shut them down. I was not updating them as much and focusing to much on maintaining and updating the site. With family and work I am very busy like many of you. A friend introduced me to Wyam.io which is a static site generator and hosting using Azure Blob Storage.</description>
