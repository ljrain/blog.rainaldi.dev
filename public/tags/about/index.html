      Make A Difference
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Everyone can make a difference. If you care about something, stand up, put yourself out there and do something.
The smallest thing can make a difference and if enough people do something small the change can be huge. We live in a world that is full of advancements and luxuries that where science fiction a few decades ago. Yet, we have a world that is so full of sadness and darkness.

      Why I Do What I Do
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    I have been blogging since 2011! WOW!
Why do I blog? Technology Geek I work in technology and enjoy technology. I am amazed by the advancements that we are seeing on a rapid pace. I remember in the early 90s setting up internet “newsgroup” for a corporate BBS, before the web was what it is today. Now, people have access to so much information in the palms of their hands.

      2016 - Year In Review
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    This year saw changes in my work life, I was contacted by a previous employer to come back as a principal engineer. The company and boss made this decision very easy, now that I am at a large international company some of my daily responsibilities have changed. But, all in all I am doing the same thing that I have been doing for that past 15+ years. I have been very involved with the social media communities and especially Pittsburgh based communities.

      Introducing the new Rainaldi.org
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    Well, as part of my cleanup and organization project with my domain names I decided to keep Rainaldi.org as my resume and technology blog. I will blog about things that I work with as well as new technologies.
Having been in the computer industry professionally for over 15 years now, I have been involved in projects covering various aspects of technology throughout several industries. I have benefited from this depth by gaining a strong knowledge of solution design and business practices from some of the best people in the industry and expanding my knowledge set to handling many different situations.
