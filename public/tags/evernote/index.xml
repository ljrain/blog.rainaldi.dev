      <description>I started using Evernote back in 2011 and have found it to be so valuable to my everyday life. I use Evernote to log notes about my professional and personal life.
I keep my notes in Evernote organized with tags and notebooks. I have found it so easy to find information that I created. The ability to have my notes with me on my phone and computer made information easily available at anytime.</description>
