      <description>Make A Difference Everyone can make a difference. If you care about something, stand up, put yourself out there and do something. The smallest thing can make a difference and if enough people do something small the change can be huge. We live in a world that is full of advancements and luxuries that where science fiction a few decades ago. Yet, we have a world that is so full of sadness and darkness.</description>

      <description>Why I do what I do I have been blogging since 2011! WOW!
Why do I blog? Technology Geek I work in technology and enjoy technology. I am amazed by the advancements that we are seeing on a rapid pace. I remember in the early 90s setting up internet “newsgroup” for a corporate BBS, before the web was what it is today. Now, people have access to so much information in the palms of their hands.</description>

      <description>Year In Review This year saw changes in my work life, I was contacted by a previous employer to come back as a principal engineer. The company and boss made this decision very easy, now that I am at a large international company some of my daily responsibilities have changed. But, all in all I am doing the same thing that I have been doing for that past 15+ years.</description>
