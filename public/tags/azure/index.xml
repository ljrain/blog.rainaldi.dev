      <description>I am excited about a new project that I am involved in. We are moving our Business Intellignece System to a Data Lake. This has been in discussion for some time now, another team in our company is already using Azure Data Lake and having some great results. This project is challenging as well as fun, I am a tech guy&amp;hellip;
I have learned so much during the planning of this project and we are ready to move to implementation.</description>

      <description>UPDATED: March 10, 2019
I have had many different sites over the years.
Recently, a few months ago I decided to shut them down. I was not updating them as much and focusing to much on maintaining and updating the site. With family and work I am very busy like many of you. A friend introduced me to Wyam.io which is a static site generator and hosting using Azure Blob Storage.</description>
