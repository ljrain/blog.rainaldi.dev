## Welcome
This is my personal blog. As a technologist for over 25 years I have always valued myself for taking on challenges and finding solutions. Would you like to learn [more about me](/about)?

I enjoy writing, it relaxes me and allows me to focus and think.

Having been in the computer industry professional for over 20 years I have experienced a lot of changes. Technology changes fast and we must stay current with advances and changes.

My blog originally started in 2011 and has spawned into other blogs over the years.
