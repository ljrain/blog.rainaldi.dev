## Welcome to my pesonal blog.

![Back in 2013 busy working](/images/2013/lou_mac_windows_ipad_computers_busy.jpeg")

Having been in the computer industry professional for over 20 years I have experienced a lot of changes. Technology changes fast and we must stay current with advances and changes.

My blog originally started in 2011 and has spawned into other blogs over the years.

Remembering back to my early days, running a WildCat BBS with two dial up lines. Adding _usenet_ groups and connecting a remote office. I was in sale at the time and selling computers, I was also the tech and trainer. Connecting the two systems provided a community for our customers and anyone else that would dial in.

I was later a network administrator with a consulting computer while learning programming. Become an **MCSE** _Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer with Windows NT 4.0_. I really found my fit when I programming just _clicked_, things made sense.

Slowly I began to work with consultants and with companies to build web applications and server side code to automate business processes. Learning new technologies as they became available and integrating systems with custom code.
