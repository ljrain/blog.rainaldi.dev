I originally started blogging back in 2011 using WordPress. I had a project I was working on with Wordpress and decided to implement an instance for myself. 

Because this is my personal blog and I wanted to reduce costs as well as learn some new technologies. I decided to switch to a Static Site Generator. Originally, I was looking at [Wyam.io](https://www.wyam.io) but decided to use [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io).

## Why Hugo?
Hugo has a large amount of themes available to choose from. I didnâ€™t want to have to create my own theme for this blog, this is for recording my notes and thoughts on technology. I wanted to use the majority of my time for creating content.  Also, the Hugo documentation is very detailed, which I found extremely useful. It was detailed but still an easy read that I was able to go through and put this site together very quickly.
