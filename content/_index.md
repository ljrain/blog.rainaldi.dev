Testing build from forestry -> Netlify -> LIVE

This site has been migrated from [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) to a Static Site that is generated by [GoHugo.io](https://www.gohugo.io) hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

This makes me think of my first online presence. A [Wildcat! BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat!_BBS) that connected using dial up to another WildCat BBS. We have seen so many advancements since my first BBS back in the 90s.

I was really impressed when I started to learn about Static Site Generators and the use of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). I have been using Markdown for private journal and also notes for a long time. I had Markdown turned on with  WordPress also.

Now, all of my content is written in MarkDown and Hugo generates a static site that I deploy to Google Firebase hosting.

[Why I do what I do](/posts/2016/09/why-i-do-what-i-do/), I enjoyed this post and it really provides more information about me and what I do.
