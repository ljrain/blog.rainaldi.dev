This is my personal blog. As a technologist for over 25 years I have always valued myself for taking on challenges and finding solutions. Would you like to learn [more about me](/about)?

[Why I do what I do](/posts/2016/09/why-i-do-what-i-do/), I enjoyed this post and it really provides more information about me and what I do.

Having been in the computer industry professional for over 20 years I have experienced a lot of changes. Technology changes fast and we must stay current with advances and changes.

My blog originally started in 2011 and has spawned into other blogs over the years.
