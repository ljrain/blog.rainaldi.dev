My Personal blog on technology

I am a principal engineer, which means I design architectures for systems. With this site, I wanted to be able to focus on content and sharing what I am learning. Using Markdown and Hugo makes this very easy and also provides me the option of customizing without a huge amount of effort. _Unless, of course I want to put the time in and really customize a site._

**This repository contains the source including content for my personal blog.**
